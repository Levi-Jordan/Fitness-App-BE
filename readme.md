Back end for a calorie tracker, and in time- perhaps a full fitness logger that could include weightlifting and cardio. 

The purpose of this application is to allow for the user to track their goals and be able to see the progress being made.
There will be a page for a goals overview (weight loss, gain, maintenance, and target cal) and one for tracking calories and macros such as protein, fat, and carbs. I plan to have a user sign up and log in form so that personal data can be easily tracked and stored and pulled from a MongoDB database. This means creating CRUD pathways for the user so that they can modify their data and make any necessary changes. 

I hope to add in charts that directly respond to the user input - as well as what has been tracked of the user information in the corresponding database logs, as I feel that visuals are very helpful to goal visualization. I think a streak system for activity could also be good for conistent use, with the dashboard displaying this upon logging in. 

Plan:
Research documentation for chart.js
Wireframe website / requirements analysis 
Create forms for front end and schemas for back end
Create routes and pathways
Implement auth / verification into the back end 
Create components for front end such as standard nav bar and other elements for conistency
